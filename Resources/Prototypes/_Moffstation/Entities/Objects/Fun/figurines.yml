# --- GENERAL FORMATTING ---
# Relevant yaml files, lists or databases should include figurines in alphabetical order
# Figurine IDs and relevant files should be written using the character's given name, not the figurine's name. This is usually just their first name, or whatever you'd normally scream over comms for their attention (e.g. "Tania" for Tania Buttersworth, "Gigs" for Works-Many-Gigs, "Polly" for Pollyari)
# Figurines use the "BaseFigurineMoff" parent

# --- NAMES & DESC ---
# Figurine names should be written from the perspective of someone who *doesn't* know your character, i.e. "Green Lizard Figurine", "Pink Moth Figurine", "Yellow Slime CMO Figurine", e.t.c.
# Descriptions should be written in the form of "A figurine depicting...", and again, written from the perspective of someone who *doesn't* know your character. Avoid name dropping the character..

# --- VOICE LINES ---
# Voice lines can contain identifying information, like the character's name.
# Voice lines should be semi iconic or unique to that character. A passing greeting, a catchphrase, something they often say on the job, a throwback to a round they remember well.
# Voice lines should be written without an accent, if an accent is added it should be done via the accent component in post.
# Voice lines should be written with proper grammar and spelling, unless doing otherwise is an explicit feature of the character.
# Voice lines should not have excessive punctuation, no more than 2 "!" at the end of a sentence. They're figurines with tiny piezoelectrics, not loudspeakers.
