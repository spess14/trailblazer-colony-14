    content: "A photo of Seikret, and what appears to be her two coworkers during her time as a Salvager, along with an Engineer. She looks younger, and happier, with no sign of any scarring. She's flashing the camera a grin and a thumbs up. Her other arm is wrapped around the shoulder of the Engineer. Turning the photo over, some names and words are written. Some sentences are weathered and illegible.\n'Tony - I tried that drink, it's good.'\n'Will - I still remember you .'\n'Isaac - I'm sorry for letting you go.'"
