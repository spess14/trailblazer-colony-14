# This is a basic list that specifies files for which the prototypes inside of them will be made abstract.
# This supports all prototype kinds and is intended to allow servers to remove prototypes in a relatively clean way.
# This method does not break inheritance, but you will still have to remove usages.

# e.g., you can specify both directories and specific files by adding lines like:
#
# - /Prototypes/Guidebook
# - /Prototypes/Catalog/uplink_catalog.yml
- /Prototypes/lobbyscreens.yml # Moffstation
- /Prototypes/Recipes/Construction/Graphs/structures/soil.yml # TC14 - we have our own soil recipe
# TC14 - Begin - Disable all guidebooks that are not ours
- /Prototypes/Guidebook
- /Prototypes/_Moffstation/Guidebook
- /Prototypes/_Impstation/Guidebook
- /Prototypes/_Harmony/Guidebook
# TC14 - End
# TC14 - Begin - Remove personal items from Moffstation
- /Prototypes/_Moffstation/PersonalItems
# TC14 - End
- /Prototypes/lobbyscreens.yml
