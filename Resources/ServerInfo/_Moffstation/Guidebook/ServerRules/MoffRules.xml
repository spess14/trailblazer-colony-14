  # Player Expectations


  ## Welcome to Moffstation
  Welcome to our Station! Please read everything so that you know what's expected of you.

  We expect players to roughly follow the rules of Wizden MRP, though more leniency is granted towards actions that promote roleplay.
  - [textlink="Wizden MRP Rules" link="MRPRuleset"]

  This includes obeying the metashield and following silicon laws
  - [textlink="Metashield" link="RuleR4"]
  - [textlink="Silicon rules" link="SiliconRules"]

  If you are unsure if something you want to do follows this server's expectations, please get permission from an admin via AHelp.

  If you would like to play as a friendly antag (wizard, operative, etc.), please get an admin's permission first.
