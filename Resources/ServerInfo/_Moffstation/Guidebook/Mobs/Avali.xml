  ## Ammonia

  Avali are humanoid creatures comparable to feathered raptors. To withstand the freezing conditions of their home world of Avalon, their biology is much different to many other humanoid species. For example, to prevent their blood from freezing on their homeworld, Avali blood consists largely of ammonia, making the consumption of the chemical essential for their hydration (with water barely hydrating them at all!)
  While ammonia may be hard to come by outside of chemistry, Avali crew members are equipped with a dedicated bottle in their survival box.

  In case there is no chemist to refill your bottle, an Avali can resort to space cleaner for their hydration needs, made easily available from janitorial. Avali can also drink diethylamine as an ammonia-based alcoholic beverage.

  ## Emp / Ion Storm Weakness

  Both in part due to Avalon culture, and the difference in environmental conditions between their homeworld and the average space station, all Avali crew members are augmented with various cybernetics that facilitate their function. With augmentations supporting sight, motor function, temperature regulation and others, Avali may become very vulnerable to effects that disrupt the function of electronic devices.

  When in the radius of an EMP blast, an Avali will become stunned for a brief duration, falling over, dropping anything they are holding and becoming temporarily blind while affected. These side effects will subside, but the process can be quite painful for some.
  Additionally, this phenomenon can also occur during an ion storm. If you see an Avali crew member randomly fall over and start screaming, it may be a sign to ask a cyborg to state its laws!

  ## Cold Resistance
  Avali take decreased damage from cold and have a lower comfortable temperature due to their nature, generally becoming extremely uncomfortable when in hot environments. As a bartender, try asking Avali patrons if they would like their drink iced!
