This is a guide for the parts of character creation that effect gameplay.

## Jobs
You can set your job preferences in the lobby. Of course, the only job available to you is the colonist.

## Loadouts
You may also choose [color=#a4885c]loadouts[/color]. Loadouts are the clothing items and trinkets that you spawn with upon joining the game. Some loadout items are locked behind playtime restrictions.
This may have various effects on gameplay, as some clothing items have [color=#a4885c]armor protection[/color] or [color=#a4885c]slow down your movement speed[/color].

You may also choose what bag you spawn in with.
[color=#a4885c]Backpacks[/color] are medium sized but can carry large items easier. [color=#a4885c]Satchels[/color] have more total space than backpacks but have trouble carrying large items. [color=#a4885c]Duffel bags[/color] are large but incur a movement penalty.

## Traits
Speech traits alter your speech, sometimes to an extreme degree.

They include:
- Accentless (disables the accent of your selected species)
- Cowboy accent (word replacement, partner)
- Frontal lisp ("s" is replaced with "th")
- Italian accent (Mamma-mia, word replacement)
- Pathological liar (word replacement, changes words like "yes" to "no")
- Pirate accent (Arrgh, word replacement)
- Social anxiety (s-s-stutter)
- Southern Drawl (replaces "-ing" with "-in'" and similar changes)

You should be comfortable with talking normally or with a minor accent such as Social anxiety or Southern drawl before taking heavy accents like Italian or Cowboy.

There are also disability traits. Familiarize yourself with the game and the game's flow before taking one of these, as some may become difficult for beginners to deal with.

They include:
- Blindness (severely limits your vision)
- Lightweight drunk (you get drunk faster and you suffer more from the ill-effects of alcohol)
- Muted (you cannot talk or whisper, but you can still communicate via emotes and pen and paper)
- Narcolepsy (you randomly fall asleep at unpredictable and often inconvenient times)
- Pacifist (you cannot hit, shoot, or throw sharp objects at people)
- Paracusia (you sometimes hear noises that aren't real)
- Short-sighted (somewhat limits your vision without prescription glasses)
- Snoring (you make loud snoring sounds when asleep)
- Unrevivable (you cannot be resuscitated when you meet your untimely demise)
