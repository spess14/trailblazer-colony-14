  # Early Progression
  If you are reading this, you have just crashlanded on a planet with little supplies.

  First of all, analyze the flora. You should be able to find solid material to make tools and shelter out of: usually, it's wood or something similar.

  Try to locate rocks nearby. By using a rock on another rock, you will create a basic cutting tool: it can be used for cutting things out of wood.

  You should be able to make crude tools out of wood and stone.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="StoneShovel"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Chisel"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Mortar"/>
  </Box>

  With basic tools and materials, you should look for a place to settle. It is recommended to settle in a place with moderate temperature and flowing water nearby.
  If you wish to build out of stone, use your chisel on rocks to make stone bricks.

  With shelter being established, it is time to look into food production.

  In order to make advanced items, you will need better workstations and research.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Smeltery"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="BlueprintWorkbench"/>
  </Box>

  Finally, some research will require you to make plastic. Simple bioplastic can be made by mixing cornmeal and fat 5:2 and heating it up.
