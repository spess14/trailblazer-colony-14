  # Research
  Surprise: you do not have the whole compendium of all sentients' knowledge of the past millenniums. However, you know a thing or two: to reproduce some technology, you just need to conduct some experiments.

  First of all, you have to store all the technobabble somewhere.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ResearchWorkbench"/>

  Research Workbench stores your research: if it's destroyed, your settlement also rolls back to the stone age.
  Each research entry has different disciplines: your PhD in biology won't help as much with electricity.
  To get research points, you need another storage of technobabble - this time, you will be the one writing it.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ObservationKit"/>
  </Box>

  Finally, you'll need something you can observe for points. These are either prototypes or regular items.
  In order to actually generate points from the prototype, you will need to experiment with it - I'm sure you'll figure it out.
  Be careful - you will DESTROY the item you're observing. Also, most prototypes are rather fragile - you can (and probably will) break them during experimentation.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SkeletonModel"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ElectrodesPrototype"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="TomatoSeeds"/>
  </Box>

  The rest is simple: use the observation kit on the prototype/item with points, then use the observation kit on your nearest Research Workbench.

  To use your blueprint, simply click it on the nearest workbench or lathe, which will add the recipe to that workstation.
