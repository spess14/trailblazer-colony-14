  # Core Rule 0.1 - Players must be and act at least 16 years old
  All players must be at least 16 years old - this is a zero tolerance rule.
  Additionally, all players must act at least as mature as a 16 year old. Admins may ban someone who they believe is acting less mature than a 16 year old, even if the player is known to be significantly older than 16 years old. This part of the rule is not covered by the "zero tolerance" policy.

  Anyone who connects to the servers is a player, even if they don't actually play in a round.
