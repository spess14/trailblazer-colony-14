  # Roleplay Rule 1.4 - Self-antagging is FAKE! Follow escalation rules
  Antagonists gain some leniency, but you are NOT exempt from this rule if you're an antagonist.

  Conflict between characters or factions is natural for this fork and encouraged. Do not use this as an excuse to bait conflict or murderbone.
  All conflicts must still be properly escalated. Randomly killing a person without a reason, even with a warning, is not sufficient escalation.

  ## How to escalate properly?
  Most conflicts must start with verbal escalation. Here are some examples:
  - Good: Telling someone that you are going to kill them if they don't give you their things.
  - Good: Warning someone approaching your faction camp to leave, unless they want to die.
  - Good: Attacking a member of a hostile faction, even without verbal escalation, as long as the declaration of hostility has been declared between your factions (explained later).
  - Good: Seeing an unknown person in your camp while being a member of a somewhat isolationist faction, pulling out weapons and telling them to state their purpose here or die.
  - Bad: Seeing an unknown person in your camp while being a member of a somewhat isolationist faction and killing them on sight.
  - Bad: Killing someone simply because you don't like them.

  ## What is a declaration of hostility?
  Declaration of hostility is verbal escalation between groups of people. It requires everyone involved to be notified sufficiently about it before it becomes valid.
  For example: faction A declares war on faction B. In order to do that, they send a person to faction B's land to notify them, and they also notify everyone in faction A about the war.
